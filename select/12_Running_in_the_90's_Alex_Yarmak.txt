Modern talking, modern walking in the streets
New desire, take me higher
Lift me higher with your speed
I need fire
Get the satellite
If you want to see me
Talking on the net
I know the way you like it
Get your credit cards
'Cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby
Runnin' in the nineties
Is a new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
Come on, baby, run to me
We are running in the nineties
Is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
Yes, I wanna know, yes, I wanna see
Cyber talking
Cybersex is on the line
New desire
Take me higher
Boost me higher with your mind
Set me on fire
Get the satellite
If you want to see me
Talking on the net
I know the way you like it
Get your credit cards
'Cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby
Running in the nineties
Is a new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
Come on baby run to me
We are running in the nineties
Is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
Yes, I wanna know, yes, I wanna see
