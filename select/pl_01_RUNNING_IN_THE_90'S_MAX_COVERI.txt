Running in the nineties
Running in the nineties, is a
new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
come on baby run to me
We are running in the nineties,
is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
yes I wanna know, yes I wanna
see
Modem talking, modern walking
in the streets
New desire, take me higher
Lift me higher with your speed
I need fire
Get the satellite if you want
to see me
Talking on the net I know the
way you like it
Get your credit card cause I
need no money
All I wanna get is you baby
Running in the nineties, is a
new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
come on baby run to me
We are running in the nineties,
is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
yes I wanna know, yes I wanna
see
Running in the nineties
(Dance to the heartbeat)
Running in the nineties
(Dance to the heartbeat)
