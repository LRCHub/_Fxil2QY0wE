Modern talking, modern walking in the streets
New desire, take me higher
Lift me higher with your speed
I need fire

Get the satellite
If you want to see me
Talking on the net
I know the way you like it
Get your credit cards
'Cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby

Running in the nineties
Is a new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
Come on, baby, run to me
We are running in the nineties
Is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
Yes, I wanna know
Yes, I wanna see

Cyber talking
Cybersex is on the line
New desire, take me higher
Boost me higher with your mind
Set me on fire

Get the satellite
If you want to see me
Talking on the net
I know the way you like it
Get your credit cards
'Cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby

Running in the nineties
Is a new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
Come on, baby, run to me
We are running in the nineties
Is a new way to set me free
I'm just running in the nineties
Yes, I wanna know
Yes, I wanna see

New desire

I need fire

Running in the nineties
Is a new way I like to be
I'm just running in the nineties
Come on, baby, run to me
We are running in the nineties

Yes, I wanna know
Yes, I wanna see

Take me higher
Lift me higher with your speed
I need fire

Get the satellite
Talking on the net
Get your credit cards
All I wanna get

Running in the nineties

Running in the nineties
