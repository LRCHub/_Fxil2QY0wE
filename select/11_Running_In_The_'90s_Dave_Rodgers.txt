Modem talking, modern walking in the streets
New desire
Take me higher, lift me higher with your speed
I need fire

Get the satellite, if you want to see me
Talking on the net, I know the way you like it
Get your credit card 'cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby

Runnin' in the 90's is a new way I like to be
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Come on, baby, run to me
We are runnin' in the 90's, it's a new way to set me free
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Yes, I wanna know, yes, I wanna see

Cyber talking, cybersex is on the line
New desire
Take me higher, boost me higher with your mind
Set me on fire
Get the satellite, if you want to see me
Talking on the net, I know the way you like it
Get your credit card 'cause I need no money
All I wanna get is you, baby

Runnin' in the 90's is a new way I like to be
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Come on, baby, run to me
We are runnin' in the 90's, it's a new way to set me free
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Yes, I wanna know, yes, I wanna see

New desire, I need fire

Runnin' in the 90's is a new way I like to be
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Come on, baby, run to me
We are runnin' in the 90's, it's a new way to set me free
I'm just runnin' in the 90's
Yes, I wanna know, yes, I wanna see

Take me higher, lift me higher with your speed
I need fire
Get the satellite, talking on the net
Get your credit card, all I wanna get
Runnin' in the 90's, Runnin' in the 90's
Runnin' in the 90's, Runnin' in the 90's
